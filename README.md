# smtp-gmail-relay
A simple unauthenticated smtp server that will resend the emails via gmail

## Why?
This service is intended to be executed inside a docker network, to provide a simple email service for the rest of the services in the network, and encapsulating the logic and credentials to send the email through gmail
